# HPCRSE@RSECon24 Birds of a Feather

Taking place at [RSECon24, Newcastle](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/) on **Thursday, Septemeber 5th, 09:30 - 12:30**

- [Session description in RSECon24 programme](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/49081/submission/43)

## Session description

This event brings together the community of RSEs working in High Performance Computing (HPC). The community covers a range of RSE roles from development of research software to support of HPC facilities, providing support to researchers. Our objectives are to provide peer support across the RSE HPC community, share experience and best practice, foster an open, self-sustaining community and collaborate with other, associated communities and organisations.

The aims of the event are to share knowledge about the current “state-of-the-nation” in HPC, discuss topics of interest in the community, understand community priorities and needs, create a forum for network building and provide peer support to HPC RSEs: particularly those new to the HPC area and those working without support from a large RSE group.

The event is split into two sessions: technical and training/community, with a break in between where HPC service providers can display small posters with updates on their services. Each session starts with two short presentations for setting the scene, followed by a panel discussion. In the technical session, HPC centres are invited to give lightning updates to support their poster submissions. Based on discussions in previous events, we have identified the some topics of particular interest, but the discussion will be driven by the attendees on the day (both online and in person). Proposed technical topics: technological developments (e.g. new accelerator technology, exascale, new service), parallel programming approaches, AI/ML. Proposed training/community topics: training for RSEs, HPC RSE career progression/skills, community organisation and sustainability.

### Prerequisites

No prior knowledge is required to engage with the BoF. The topics of the BoF are of broad interest across HPC and related disciplines so should be applicable to attendees from academia, industry, the public and third sectors.

### Outcomes

Outcomes for BoF attendees: to understand the current state of play in the field of HPC, particularly in the UK; to gain current information on the state of HPC services and any plans for the future; to better understand the topics of interest across the HPC community and the wider community’s opinions on these topics; to build personal and professional networks; to gain better access to peer support, especially for RSEs new to HPC. Outcomes from the BoF: blog article describing the BoF and discussions that took place; online versions of presentation slides from the BoF; online versions of HPC service update posters from the BoF; concrete plans for future HPC RSE events; additional volunteers to help organise and guide the community and plan future events; timeline to establish the HPC RSE community as an official SIG within the Society of Research Software Engineering.
